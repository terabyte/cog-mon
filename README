If you don't have rvm, get rvm (or rbenv):
http://rvm.io/rvm/install

To install the dependencies:
rvm install ruby-2.1.1
rvm use --create ruby-2.1.1@cog-mon
bundle install
bundle exec bin/check_hashrate.rb

the script returns true/false on success/fail, and only prints out anything if
things fail.  Typical failure output looks like this:

ERROR: TerraMiner0 is hashing at 1284000000000.0 but 1500000000000.0 is expected (85.6%)
ERROR: TerraMiner1 is not hashing at all!
ERROR: TerraMiner7 is not hashing at all!

You could run this on a 5-minute crontab, for example, cron automatically sends
emails only on failure.  You can set your MAILTO in the crontab to be the
address you want notified (for example, most cell providers have an
email-to-sms bridge too).  Instead of running `bundle exec FOO` you can run
RVM's wrapper script for that gemset to ensure the script runs with the proper
dependencies.  See the example below.  A sample crontab might look like this:

MAILTO="XXXXXXXXXX@vtext.com" # 10-digit number @ vtext.com works for verizon customers
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/5 * * * * /home/USERNAME/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-2.1.1@cog-mon/wrappers/ruby /home/USERNAME/cog-mon/bin/check_hashrate.rb

FUTURE FEATURES/BUGS/TODO:
1. Break out devices into a config file
2. take some action on error
3. ???
